Hi There! im ilham as the publisher of this code. 
This code is a combination of codes created by several people on the internet which I have also modified for my research purposes.
This code is formatted in ipynb and works on vsc and google collab by changing the csv format into the google drive links
```
data = pd.read_csv("SARCASMMMIXEDD.csv",on_bad_lines='skip')
#into
data = pd.read_csv("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=[code]",on_bad_lines='skip')
```
the code on "id=[code]" refer to the code behind the id when you share the files from google drive.
I hope you understand the operation of this code, Thank you
