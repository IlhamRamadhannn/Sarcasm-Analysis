1,If it's like a vaccine then why aren't all breastfed babies autistic?,Skydivekingair,AskReddit,1,1,0,2015-09,9/22/2015 11:57,"Breastmilk actually changes it's composition to meet the individual nutritional needs of the baby(ies) feeding from the breast. For example, if mom is nursing a toddler (who is more prone to short little ""drive by"" nursings) the child get more bang for their buck and gets a full session's worth of proteins, fats and vitamins in their one minute fly by the same as a 3 month old gets in their 25 minute session. As they get older, the quantity of vitamins, fats and proteins changes as well to meet their individual needs. This is even true if mom is tandem nursing two babies of different ages: the milk actually customizes itself to ensure they both get exactly what they need, and the amount of milk she makes is dependent entirely on how much stimulation she gets (ie. the more the baby nurses at the breast, the better supplied they are. This is why using bottles and pacifiers mucks up someone's supply: the baby wastes all their suckling needs somewhere else). Even cooler, the milk makes antibodies for the viruses mom and baby are exposed to and fighting off. I always thought the coolest part in particular was that before the mom even know she or her baby are sick, her milk is already creating medicine (antibodies) to treat her child. It's like a built-in vaccine that is constantly being updated to fight off the latest bugs. This is the main reason why breastfed babies are better equipped to fight off both short term illness and long term disease (like respiratory illness, asthma, allergies, etc). And it comes in a real pretty container, too."

He traded Boykin because we had a replacement and the replacement had a season ending injury. The same thing could have happened to Boykin if we kept him. You can't hold that against Chip. He released Evan Mathis because it was time to move on from Evan Mathis in his eyes. According to every metric I can find, Evan isn't doing much better than either of our guys now. I don't know how people keep saying that McCoy is correlated to our running game going down hill, but I remember most of the time he was corralled in the backfield he ended up dancing around and losing more yards. McCoy would have the same problems a different way. Byron Maxwell isn't anywhere near as bad as fans are making him out to be. He's been on the field a lot, and he's being asked to do things that aren't exactly easy. With time and adjustment around him, I'm sure he can play as well as we expected before the season. Right now, everything else sucks. Why focus on him when he's got no pass rush to work with? It's been two weeks. Get over yourself and your self-esteem. Half of teams that play lose. One fourth of teams that play two weeks lose both. Coming off of two 10-6 seasons, you're going to say Chip isn't a Philly guy because he's lost two games and taken some chances to finally make us great? Fuck you. Maybe YOU'RE not a Philadelphia guy. Go follow a less embarrassing team and maybe one day you'll learn that there is no greatness without risk."

Do you know the size of the tire on your car? TG: No. ME: Not a problem what is the Year, make, and model of the car? TG: Um It's a Chevy, but it does not have factory rims. I pimped it out last year it's so badass. ME: Well since the rims are not original I cannot give you a quote unless I have the tire size. If you have the car here You can show me, and I can get that tire size for you. TG: I do not have it here. Why the hell would I drive it here if I need new tires? ME: Well if you get the tire size off the sidewall of the tire when you get home you can call, and I can give you a quote over the phone. TG: But I want the quote now! ME: Sorry sir without a tire size there is nothing I can do. TG: What kind of Bullcrap is this. You work with tires you know what kind of tires it takes. ME: Sorry sir, but there are all kinds of tire sizes, and there is no chance I can know all of them from memory. TG: Your a complete idiot! Why Do I EFFIN EVEN COME HERE IF YOU EFFIN DO NOT KNOW A DANG THING ABOUT EFFIN CARS!! ME: Sir can I ask that you calm down there is nothing I can do without a tire size, and I cannot look it up by YMM because there after market rims. TG: SHUT THE F UP. IF I WANT TO HEAR AN IDIOT TALK I WI-- ME:(cutting him off) WILL TALK TO YOUR SELF! I cannot pull up a tire size for a custom rim. You decided to ""PIMP"" (I actually did air quotes) your ride, but are too stupid to remember what tire size it requires. It is not my responsibility to remember what parts your vehicle takes if you customize it! They make over 400 different tire sizes, and there are over 1000 different car makes, and models of different years each using there own size, and a majority use 3 to 5 different sizes per model per year. So no one can remember all of them. I stormed off the counter while a manager who heard the commotion came running over. I walked into our office near by, and calmed down. About 15 minutes passed, and the manager walked in, and asked if I had calmed down. I told him yes, and he said get back to work then. The manager in question has a shorter temper than I do, and it takes a lot to get us that mad. I do not know why I was so angry that day. Needless to say the manager never said anything to me about it, and from what a co-worker told me he ended up telling the guy to leave because after the BS story the guy gave the manager, and the fact I rarely actually get angry outwardly at work he figured the guy was lying to him. Every once in a while since he walks by, and jokingly goes hulk smash gives me a good laugh."

Basically, each drug put on the market has to be FDA approved, even a generic, so a company buys up the rights to sell or market the currently approved drug version, getting another version approved is possible, but its not cheap or fast, the result is a temporary **government created** monopoly on a drug. Any company can get another version of the drug approved for sale, they just have to prove that their drug is pretty much the same (I think the word is ""biocompatible"" but I have closed the tab). To prevent that the usurious company restricts access to the old drug, usually by claiming it is dangerous (it sometimes is) making it impossible for a company to get a sample legally to take to the FDA in order to prove their drug is just a similar version.

1,You're the only one with this problem,Uwot666,GlobalOffensive,1,1,0,2015-10,10/4/2015 4:06,"The Problem I Face with Competitive CS:GO Hey guys! I'm Calebrox124, I'm an MGE in competitive with 160 wins and over 400 hours logged. I am on the verge of quitting Counter-Strike competitive as a whole and leaving the space all because of something I have way too much trouble with, and something that could be easily fixed with new systems implemented by Valve. Trigger warning, opinions ahead. I'm going to brag a bit during this, but only for the sake of the argument. I'd like to start off that I am NOT a bad player, by any means. I am almost always top fragging or at least mid fragging on an off day. I play with players high above my rank (i.e. LE+), and I know the atmosphere of a serious competitive match. I've seen and studied almost every WarOwl video since August of last year, perfecting my own game and learning all of the newest strategies and metas. I'm a sick flick shot with the AWP, and I can rotate faster than a revolving door. I study all of the new updates and how they compare or conflict with my gaming style. I have put in the work it takes to be a necessary part of any team, and I am very active in the eSports scene, especially anticipating ESL's next major (Virtus Plow!). Everything the pros do, I try to reflect in my own playstyle. I have put in the time and effort into practicing, warming up, and eventually playing competitively in CS:GO's matchmaking. And I get absolutely shit on by my teammates and the enemies. The problem I face with competitive CS:GO is the lack of caring teammates, and how frankly easy it is to get to certain ranks. I have two points to make on this topic. First, for the LOVE OF GOD GABEN, make AT LEAST the top fourth of the ranks hard as all Hell to get into. No one who is intensely salty, doesn't use strats, or simply gets carried to the rank should be allowed to stay there. This is my biggest complaint, because I see every single day noobs who come to this rank, in which I get queued with them because it's tough to get a full lobby (more on that later) and ruin the game for everyone. It especially kills me to see people who are LE+ with less common sense than I do. This isn't a complaint for my own sake, I'm not crying because I wasn't carried into the higher ranks. I'm saying that around MG2, people should start to get tested heavily with teamwork and compatibility. If your teammates don't get along well with you because you're an ass, that should reflect on your rank. This same principle affects every other aspect of life. Secondly, I'm going to complain about my fellow teammates. I'm the type of person who can really shine with a full 5-man team, all working together, peaking together, doing strats together and all that. I flourish in this atmosphere, and if this is the case, I feel my best and I can play my best. Unfortunately, for the other 90% of the time, I'm stuck with idiots who don't even know their spray patterns, yet have 200$+ knives. I need more than someone with the ability to aim well in on my team, and matchmaking isn't somewhere I can find this. And it's not as simple as asking around, finding good players and queuing with them solely. In the MGE levels, it's mainly full of newb idiots or smurfs. The one or two ""good"" players that do come on don't play often enough to be interested in a long-term engagement. Through the entirety of my time playing CS:GO, I can count on my hand the amount of people who turned out like me, and most of them don't play anymore for the same complaint as this; lack of caring and ""good"" teammates. This is another problem that would be fixed with better, more personal rankings for matchmaking. In conclusion, I've hit a wall with how much I can improve on myself without a team to improve with. I have no more drive to be promoted, and I don't see the point in trying anymore. Every game's the same, and not even a 5-man lobby with LE's can make a difference when I'm mid-top fragging every game, yet still losing because the LEM has 4 kills by the end of the first half (yes, this happened today.) I need advice. It's why I've come here. I need help finding motivation, and if anything, proper teammates. If anyone out there feels the same as I do, let me know by a reply. I'll be watching this thread for a while, and I'll be thankful for any attention. Thanks for reading my rant! You guys are awesome! (P.S. This is the time when I ask if anyone else is stuck in the same situation as me. If so, for the love of God, add me on Steam. I'd love to meet you. IG: Calebrox124)"

Rohan, Lineage2 and Perfect world all shared this. games that allow pvp in towns are typically faction games. Aion, Archeage, World of Warcraft (OMG BUZZWORD better downvote to prevent wowscape xD) allow pvp in towns and use massively OP guards to protect their playerbase within them. Of the games i've listed, only Rohan Lineage2 and and perfect world allow you to drop items on death, and even then only if you have flagged (initiated pvp on a non-flagged target) or gone red (killed a certain threshhold of players.) These games know that losing even one of your fancy items can be crushing, so they leave towns as safehaven against it. In Runescape where item loss on death is almost guaranteed, the unreliable guards are a horrible clumsy agency at best. The only game I've played that uses a similar system to darkscape is Darkfall, a game that allows pvp everywhere and people drop everything on death. darkfall has no quests and very few predefined towns. its the most sandbox a pvp game can get. literally nobody plays this game. The only person I know that enjoyed this game is a guy who bots every game he has ever played because he has no appreciation for storyline or leveling process. He's been kicked from guild in every game we play together because he gives guilds bad rep and all the while he still thinks his way of life in mmorpgs is correct with no remorse. my point is it is not a popular game concept at all. If the safety system in towns stays this way, the game is destined to fail. I like darkscape. I'll keep playing it as long as there's a moderate playerbase, but darkscape is even more prone to ""i lost everything and am quitting"" than rs2 was with luring and lagdeaths at unreachable places."

As a new convert 30 years ago I picked up a few history books on the church and found this out long ago. I read Michael D. Quinn's book in 1990 which was for sale in Deseret Book which talked about all of this (Quinn was active then). It surprises me when people become upset when they haven't heard of it before. There are lots of things in American history people haven't heard of either because they don't bother to pick up a history book. So now we have this inanimate object that Joseph felt he needed to help him with his role as a seer. I am not a seer, so I don't know why he needs it. Perhaps his upbringing in a world filled with superstition and magic belief made him feel the need to use a seer stone for comfort and familiarity. The Urim and Thummin were used by prophets of old to discern things until they were lost after Jerusalem was sacked by the Babylonians. These were also seer stones. Joseph of Egypt had a divining cup. We are all going to receive a white stone (seer stone?) according to Rev 2:17. So use of seer objects is nothing new. But now about olive oil, which we use (after consecration) for blessings. What magical property does olive oil have to heal us? Nothing, except through the power of the Priesthood. It is a symbol. Much like the seer stones of the prophets of old and the prophet of the restoration."

1,you suck at dota,ddsama,DotA2,0,0,0,2015-10,10/9/2015 4:23,"Why is there a cooldown on dust of appearance? So I've been playing a lot of games lately where some pleb just has to pick riki last, after everyone's already picked. Fucking great, welcome to another game of incessantly buying invis counters and wasting an entire item slot because of this little turd. Riki's build usually includes a diffusal blade which can instantly dispel the effects of dust. My question is why the fuck is there a cooldown on dust if this cheap little bastard can instantly dispel it? You're in lane, you want to kill riki, you throw the dust, and then he dispels it with his fucking diffusal. Suddenly you're at his mercy and he kills you with no effort. It's bad enough that the effects of the dust only last 12 seconds but diffusal blade makes it so that multiple people have to team up and throw 2 units of dust over the little fuck before you can kill him. Diffusal makes it literally impossible to 1vs1 Riki. In my opinion this is imbalanced. Not only does he force you to sacrifice an item slot in favor of carrying detection, but he can also instantly render that detection useless. Riki is a turd of a hero anyway with his permanant invisibility and smoke that makes you unable to hit him, but this is just ridiculous. inb4 riki pickers saying ""get gud"". Guys if you were good, you wouldn't continually pick one of the cheapest nastiest heroes in the game."

The only problem with it is how you need to meet a certain MT requirement for each game. This does nothing but promote cheesing. When you're required to get a certain amount of MT per game you're going to play the min-max game of how many points can I get by doing X number of things. It's turned basketball into a game of find what earns the most MT and repeat it over and over. If you're going to have requirements tie it to something else that allows the player freedom of play-style choices. Even tying it to score 5,10,15 more points then your opponent would be a better solution. No one enjoys having to worry about how much MT they're getting in the middle of a basketball game. Especially when you win the game, but fail because you didn't play a certain way to earn MT points."

Neither of the sides there are forcing women and children to fight. And there are plenty of areas in Syria that are relatively safe from bombs, but not safe from the different fighting armies forcing young men to fight their war. Also many families cannot pay to move everyone to Europe, on a journey that is very dangerous and expensive. Once the young man, who is most likely to survive this trip, is awarded asylum, he can get his family to safety with relative ease. Also I am not sure why the fact that many of the Refugees are young men is such an issue? Firstly they are capable of work, are less likely to have medical issue and won't draw a pension or have babies. These young men that arrive without family are also likely not to be married and even if they get asylum, they are less likely to bring their family over, as their elderly parents may not want to leave. A single man can work and send money home to support his family there. If he brings his family to Germany, he may not be able to earn enough to support them all. 1.5 million refugees are expected. But how many will be granted asylum? Many economic migrants have jumped the bandwagon and they are fast tracked straight back to where they came from. It will still be a massive challenge for Germany, and I do think other European countries should do more, but the way the economy in Italy and Greece stands, I can't see how they could possibly help. France definitely needs to do something about refugees travelling unhindered and unchecked across the whole country to reach Calais so they can risk their life to get to the UK. No one asks why they don't want to stay in France and why France doesn't stop this."
